🩺 Health Insurance Cost Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Description

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict **health insurance costs** based on various personal and lifestyle attributes. The goal is to estimate insurance charges using features such as:

- Age  
- Gender  
- BMI (Body Mass Index)  
- Number of children  
- Smoking status  
- Region  

The project walks through the full ML pipeline—from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training, evaluation, and prediction.
## Features

- 📌 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- 🧠 Regression Modeling (Linear Regression and more)  
- 🧮 Evaluation using metrics like R² Score and MAE  
- 🔮 Predicting charges for new individuals  

## Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Jupyter Notebook 📓  
- Pandas & NumPy 🧮  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 📊  
- Scikit-learn 🤖
